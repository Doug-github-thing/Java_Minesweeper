# Java_Minesweeper

This is a game that I made in my free time during college.

It is my remake of the classic computer game Minesweeper, without the added feature of flagging squares, since I don't use them when I play the game anyway.

It is the only thing I wrote back during college that has survived the move between computers since I was particularly proud of it.
